# Example usage

* powering [Councilmatic](https://github.com/codeforamerica/councilmatic/blob/master/councilmatic/phillyleg/management/scraper_wrappers/sources/hosted_legistar_scraper.py)
* [saving council agendas in to MongoDB](https://github.com/opengovernment/legistar-scrape)
* [saving councilmembers to a CSV](https://github.com/datamade/legistar-people)

## Sample script

```python
from legistar.scraper import LegistarScraper
from legistar.config import Config, DEFAULT_CONFIG

#__________________________________________________________________________
#
# Configure and create a scraper

config = Config(
  hostname = 'chicago.legistar.com',
).defaults(DEFAULT_CONFIG)
scraper = LegistarScraper(config)

#__________________________________________________________________________
#
# Get a summary listing of all of the legislation

all_legislation = scraper.searchLegislation('')

#__________________________________________________________________________
#
# Get more detail for a particular piece of legislation

for legislation_summary in all_legislation:
  (legislation_attrs, legislation_history) = \
    scraper.expandLegislationSummary(legislation_summary)
  break
# NOTE: searchLegislation returns an iterator; you may not use subscript
# indexing (e.g., all_legislation[0]). You may, however, achieve the same
# thing with all_legislation.next()

#__________________________________________________________________________
#
# Get details about legislation history, such as voting results

for history_summary in legislation_history:
  (history_detail, votes) = scraper.expandHistorySummary(history_summary)

#__________________________________________________________________________
#
# Get a list of all council members


councilmembers = scraper.councilMembers()

#__________________________________________________________________________
#
# Get a list of all upcoming agendas

councilmembers = scraper.councilCalendar()

#__________________________________________________________________________
#
# Get a list of all agendas (including past ones)

councilmembers = scraper.councilCalendar('all')

```
